In one of my simulations, I noted that there were various Levs created (Lev_A*, Lev_B*), but it still wasn't reaching a Lev_Plunge dir. I plotted the Mass vs Time, and the plot suggested there should have already been a plunge directory.
Dr. Lovelace suggested I try and force the simulation to reach a plunge. 
After some trial and error, I got it to work and everything ran smoothly.
Here's what I did:

You want to plot **your** bhns's Mass vs Time. 
     In order to do this, we have to join all the MassIntegral.dat files:
        1) mkdir files
        2) cd files
        3) JoinDatFiles ../Lev0_*/Run/MassIntegral.dat > MassIntegral.dat 
     On Jupyter Notebook:
        1) import numpy as np
        2) %matplotlib inline 
        3) from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
        4) massinteg=np.genfromtxt("MassIntegral.dat")
        5) plt.plot(massinteg[:,0],massinteg[:,1])
           plt.xlabel('Rho')
           plt.ylabel('time')
           plt.show()
