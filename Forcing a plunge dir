In one of my simulations, I noted that there were various Levs created (Lev_A*, Lev_B*), but it still wasn't reaching a Lev_Plunge dir. I plotted the Mass vs Time, and the plot suggested there should have already been a plunge directory.
Dr. Lovelace suggested I try and force the simulation to reach a plunge. 
After some trial and error, I got it to work and everything ran smoothly.
Here's what I did:

You want to plot your bhns's Mass vs Time. 
     The purpose of this is to determine what segment we want to start our Plunge directory
     In order to do this, we have to join all the MassIntegral.dat files:
        1) mkdir files
        2) cd files
        3) JoinDatFiles ../Lev0_*/Run/MassIntegral.dat > MassIntegral.dat 
     On Jupyter Notebook:
        1) import numpy as np
        2) %matplotlib inline 
        3) from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
        4) massinteg=np.genfromtxt("MassIntegral.dat")
        5) plt.plot(massinteg[:,0],massinteg[:,1])
           plt.xlabel('time')
           plt.ylabel('Rho')
           plt.show()
        From this plot you should see a a somewhat horizontal line that ultimately plummets over time. 
        Determine the Rho value before the line begins to obvioulsy dip. 
        From there, determine what segment that Rho value pertains to. The segment after this will be our Lev_Plunge.
        My Rho value was 0.643 and that belonged to Lev0_AJ

Go to Lev0_AK:
        1) cd Run
        2) head MassIntegral.dat 
        # Copy the first Rho value.
In your Ev directory:
        1) mkdir goner
        2) mv EveryLevDirAfterLev0_AJ goner
        # Don't forget to load your spec modules!
        3) MakeNextSegment -d Lev0_AJ/
        4) cd Lev0_AK
        5) emacs Evolution.input
        # Scroll to line 63, or "Target=0.506401470063149;" Delete the target number and paste your copied Rho value then save.
        6) cd ../
        7) qsub Submit.sh
      It might take 1 or 2 new Levs before the Lev_Plunge is made, but everything should work.
